Sample question:-

A deployment named fruits in the namespace salad has three containers:

    apple
    banana, and
    kiwi

One of these containers has the package curl installed. Identify which container has that package from the running containers, and create an SBOM SPDX for the container's image.

Use the tarball archive of that particular image stored under /root/ImageTarballs directory for generating the SPDX JSON. The archives have names matching their images.

Save the output in ~/bugged-fruit.spdx. Save the container name in ~/bugged-container.txt.

Note: bom as well as all its required dependencies have already been installed.
 
Answer:-

Key word is bom and --help and navigate this belo command to generate the spdx report and save it 

bom generate \
  --image /root/ImageTarballs/<image-name>.tar \
  --format json \
  -o ~/bugged-fruit.spdx
